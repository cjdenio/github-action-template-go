# GitHub Action Template: Go

Stuff to take notice of:

1. Inputs are passed as environment variables to your Go script.
2. To emulate the behavior of the GitHub Actions JavaScript library, you'll need to work with some [workflow commands](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions).
